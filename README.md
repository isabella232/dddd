# Developers Developers Developers Developers

This is the source code to http://developersdevelopersdevelopersdevelopers.org.

It is a Ruby on Rails app that uses:

* [@font-face](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/#the-font-face-rule) for beautiful typography.
* [Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/) for storing and retrieving data.
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) to make CSS fun again.
* [Cucumber](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dddd/tree/master/features) for human-readable tests.

It is deployed to [Heroku](http://heroku.com).

## Registration

Registration is now closed as we're flirting with a fire code violation.

After registration closed, we temporarily allowed people to [hack their way into registering](http://bit.ly/curl-rails-authenticity-token)
using cURL or Web Inspector. That fun loophole is now closed.
