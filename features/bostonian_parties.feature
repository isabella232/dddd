Feature: A Bostonian parties

  In order to meet and mentor students
  As a Bostonian in the web community
  I want to attend the D8 after-party

  # Scenario: Bostonian RSVPs for after-party
  #   Given I am on the after-party page
  #   When I follow "RSVP via Twitter"
  #   And I authenticate my Twitter account
  #   Then I should see "It's only a party if you make it a party. See you there!"
